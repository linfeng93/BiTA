This will match any string that contains only letters, but will not match strings that contain non-letter characters.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the `^[a-zA-Z]+$` pattern with a negative lookahead assertion to ensure that the string does not contain any non-letter characters.

I'd be happy to help you create your own sorting algorithm.\n\nTo start, let's define what a sorting algorithm is. A sorting algorithm is a set of instructions that takes a list of items as input and produces a sorted list of those items as output. There are many different types of sorting algorithms, including bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, and more.\n\nTo create your own sorting algorithm, you can start by identifying the properties that you want your algorithm to have. For example, you might want your algorithm to be efficient, meaning it should take a reasonable amount of time to sort a list, or you might want it to be simple to understand and implement.\n\nOne simple sorting algorithm that you could create is a \"reverse insertion sort.\" Here's how it works:\n\n1. Start at the beginning of the list and compare the first two items in the list.\n2. If the first item is less than the second item, move the first item to the end of the list and start again.\n3. If the first item is greater than the second item, move the second item to the end of the list and start again.\n4. Repeat steps 1-3 until the end of the list is reached.\n\nHere's an example of how this algorithm would sort the list [3, 6, 4, 7, 1, 2]:\n\n1. Start at the beginning of the list: [3, 6, 4, 7, 1, 2]\n2. Compare the first two items: 3 and 6 are less than each other, so move 3 to the end of the list and start again.\n3. Compare the next two items: 6 and 4 are less than each other, so move 6 to the end of the list and start again.\n4. Compare the next two items: 4 and 7 are less than each other, so move 4 to the end of the list and start again.\n5. Compare the next two items: 7 and 1 are less than each other, so move 7 to the end of the list and start again.\n6. Compare the next two items: 1 and 2 are less than each other, so move 1 to the end of the list and start again.\n7. Repeat step 6 until the end of the list is reached: [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7]\n\nAs you can see, this algorithm is simple to understand and implement, but it may not be the most efficient sorting algorithm for larger lists. There are many other sorting algorithms that you could create, depending on your specific needs and requirements.\n\nI hope this helps!
