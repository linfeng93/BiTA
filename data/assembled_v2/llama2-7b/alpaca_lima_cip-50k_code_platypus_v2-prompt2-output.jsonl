The function will then return the result of the addition, which in this case is `7`.\n\nYou can also use the `()` operator to call a function as a method of an object. For example:\n```\nmy_object = MyObject()\nresult = my_object.add_two_numbers(3, 4)\n```\nIn this case, `MyObject` is a custom class that defines the `add_two_numbers` method. The `add_two_numbers` method is called on the `my_object` object, passing the arguments `3` and `4`. The result of the method call is stored in the `result` variable.\n\nYou can also use the `functools.partial` function to create a partial function that can be called with a specific set of arguments. For example:\n```\nfrom functools import partial\n\ndef add_two_numbers(x, y):\n    return x + y\n\npartial_add = partial(add_two_numbers, 3, 4)\nresult = partial_add()\n```\nIn this case, the `partial_add` function is a partial function that takes the arguments `3` and `4` and calls the `add_two_numbers` function with those arguments. The result of the partial function call is stored in the `result` variable.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.", "template_tag": "short"}
